## Design Choices

### Technology Stack

Selecting the right technology stack is crucial for building a scalable, maintainable, and high-performance application. The chosen technologies for this project are based on their robustness, community support, and compatibility with the project's requirements.

- **React:** 
  - **Reason for Choice:** React's component-based architecture allows for building reusable UI components, enhancing maintainability and scalability. Its virtual DOM ensures efficient rendering, which is essential for interactive and dynamic visualizations.
  
- **Webpack:** 
  - **Reason for Choice:** Webpack is a powerful module bundler that efficiently manages and bundles assets, ensuring optimized load times and performance. Its extensive plugin ecosystem allows for customizing the build process to suit project-specific needs.
  
- **Babel:** 
  - **Reason for Choice:** Babel transpiles modern JavaScript and JSX, ensuring compatibility across various browsers. It allows developers to use the latest language features without worrying about browser support.

- **Mermaid.js:** 
  - **Reason for Choice:** Mermaid.js is integrated for creating dynamic and interactive workflow diagrams. It enhances the project's documentation and visualization aspects by allowing the generation of diagrams from text definitions, facilitating easier updates and maintenance.

### Visualization Libraries

- **D3.js:** 
  - **Reason for Choice:** D3.js is renowned for its versatility in creating dynamic and interactive data visualizations. Its powerful data-driven approach allows for detailed and customized charting solutions, making it ideal for representing complex arms trade data.

- **Three.js:** 
  - **Reason for Choice:** Three.js enables the rendering of sophisticated 3D graphics within the browser. It's leveraged for immersive animations, such as the jet fleet visualization, providing a more engaging user experience.

- **@deck.gl:** 
  - **Reason for Choice:** @deck.gl is a WebGL-powered framework for visual exploratory data analysis of large datasets. It's used for advanced geospatial visualizations, enhancing the depth and interactivity of maps and spatial data representations.

## Design Principles

1. **Clarity and Simplicity:** Ensuring that visualizations are easy to understand, avoiding unnecessary complexity while effectively conveying the intended message.
   
2. **Interactivity:** Providing users with interactive elements such as tooltips, sliders, and clickable regions to explore data dynamically.
   
3. **Accessibility:** Designing with accessibility in mind, including ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and sufficient color contrast to support all users.
   
4. **Responsiveness:** Creating a layout that adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices, ensuring a consistent user experience.
   
5. **Performance:** Optimizing rendering and data processing to maintain smooth interactions and quick load times, even with large datasets.
   
6. **Maintainability:** Building a modular and well-documented codebase to facilitate easy updates and scalability.
